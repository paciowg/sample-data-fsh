## Release 0.1 Summary

Initial migration of the sample data originally created through manual JSON creation. Many examples were modified in order to correct FHIR validation errors which were not run in past example QA.
The original examples in their JSON format are still preserved and can be viewed in the following GitHub project: https://github.com/paciowg/sample-data 

### Suppressed Errors
* Local code systems in the CI builds point to a canonical URI that is bound to a published version.
