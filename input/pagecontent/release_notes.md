## Release 0.1 Summary

Initial migration of the sample data was based on the following events:
* [FHIR Connectathon 37 - PACIO SMP and PFE Track](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/263389262/2024+-+09+PACIO+SMP+and+PFE+Track)
* [FHIR Connectathon 38 - PACIO Integration Track](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2025+-+01+PACIO+Integration+Track) - Content Inventory [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2ZfYk89XyGLTb04piKk7IP2NzhJEQ0Gc4h1dAkooKE/edit?gid=1217152263#gid=1217152263)

The sample data was originally created through manual JSON creation. Many examples were modified in order to correct FHIR validation errors which were not run in past example QA.

For archival purposes, the original examples in their JSON format are still preserved and can be viewed in the [paciowg/sample](https://github.com/paciowg/sample-data) GitHub repository.
