Cohort Name / Title	Yes (field: `name`)	Yes (field: `name`)	Serves as the human‚Äêreadable label for the cohort definition. It provides a quick, clear reference for users and systems to identify and distinguish the cohort among many definitions.
Cohort Description / Summary	Yes (field: `description`)	Yes (field: `description`)	Offers narrative context detailing the purpose, scope, and clinical focus of the cohort. This detailed description helps users understand the intent and nuances of the defined population.
Unique Identifier	Yes (field: `identifier`)	Yes (typically embedded as a unique ID)	Ensures that each cohort definition can be uniquely referenced. A unique identifier is essential for linking, managing, and tracking cohort definitions across systems and over time.
Lifecycle Status (Active/Draft/Retired)	Yes (field: `status`)	No explicit field	Indicates the current state of the cohort (e.g., draft, active, or retired), which is critical for governance, quality control, and ensuring that only valid and current definitions are used in analyses.
Version Number	Yes (field: `version`)	No explicit version field	Supports the tracking of changes and updates over time. Versioning is important for reproducibility and clarity, ensuring that analyses refer to the correct iteration of a cohort definition.
Inclusion Criteria Expression	Yes (via `characteristic` elements with `exclude` set to false)	Yes (within the `expression` object, typically under primary inclusion criteria)	Defines the core set of conditions that patients must satisfy to be included in the cohort. This logic is fundamental as it directly determines which subjects qualify for the cohort.
Exclusion Criteria Expression	Yes (via `characteristic` elements with `exclude` set to true)	Yes (within the `expression` object, typically separated from inclusion criteria)	Specifies conditions that disqualify patients from cohort membership. Separating exclusion criteria from inclusion criteria refines the population and enhances the precision of the cohort definition.
Temporal Constraints / Observation Window	Partial (timing can be provided within individual criteria)	Yes (explicit fields for observation window start/end)	Establishes the time frame during which patient data is considered relevant (e.g., baseline or follow-up periods). This ensures that the cohort reflects a clinically meaningful period and that temporal relationships in the data are appropriately handled.
Concept Set Definitions (Clinical Code Groupings)	No explicit provision (similar logic may be managed via value sets)	Yes (explicitly defined concept sets)	Allows grouping of related clinical codes (e.g., diagnosis or procedure codes) into reusable sets. This modularity supports consistency across definitions and simplifies updates when clinical vocabularies change.
Provenance Metadata (Creation Dates, Authors, Publisher Info)	Yes (fields such as `date`, `approvalDate`, `author`, `publisher`)	Partial or Limited	Provides audit and traceability information regarding the creation and modification of the cohort definition. Provenance metadata is crucial for ensuring the integrity, accountability, and proper maintenance of cohort definitions over time.
